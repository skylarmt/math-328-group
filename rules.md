Game Rules
==========

ï»¿The board size is 10x10.

The number of monsters is found by rolling two dice and multiplying the numbers together.

The number of treasures is found the same way.

The "bad guy" chooses where to put the monsters and treasures.

The bottom and top rows cannot have monsters or treasures.

The "good guys" cannot see where the monsters and treasures are; the "bad guy" writes down the locations on a hidden piece of paper.  He must tell the other players if they land on a treasure or monster.

No two entities may occupy a single space simultaneously.

All players roll a die to determine the amount of health to start with.  The "bad guy" starts with 5x his roll, and loses points when one of his monsters is defeated.
If during the game a player's health score reaches zero, he dies in real life.  This, of course, results in disqualification from the game.

When a treasure is found by the "good guy", a die is rolled.  The number on it is added to the player's health and the treasure is removed from the board.

When a monster is found, the "bad guy" and the "good guy" who landed on the space each roll a die.  Whoever rolls the bigger number wins the round.  Three rounds are played, and best out of three wins.  In the case of a tie roll, the roll is repeated (i.e. tie rounds don't count toward the three rounds).
After the battle, both players roll a die.  The winner has his roll added to his total score, and the loser has his roll subtracted from his total.  If the "good guy" wins, the monster is removed from the board.

If all monsters are defeated and the "bad guy" is still alive:
*TODO: add stuff*
